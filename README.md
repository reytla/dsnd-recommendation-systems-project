# IBM Recommendation Systems Project

A comprehensive exploration of recommendation system algorithms using IBM Watson Studio Community data. This project implements and compares four distinct recommendation approaches: rank-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, content-based recommendations, and matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

## Project Overview

Modern recommendation systems are the backbone of user engagement across digital platforms. This project tackles the challenge of recommending relevant articles to users on IBM Watson Studio Community, exploring multiple algorithmic approaches to understand their strengths, limitations, and optimal use cases.

The dataset contains user-item interactions from IBM Watson Studio Community, providing a rich foundation for building and evaluating different recommendation strategies. Through systematic implementation and analysis, this project demonstrates how different methods excel in various scenarios and user segments.

## Key Features

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Comprehensive analysis of user interaction patterns and article popularity distributions
- Identification of data sparsity challenges and user engagement metrics
- Statistical insights into user behavior and content preferences

### **Rank-Based Recommendations**
- Implementation of popularity-based filtering using interaction frequency
- Most recommended articles identification for new users with no interaction history
- Foundation system providing baseline performance metrics

### **User-User Collaborative Filtering**
- Neighbor-based recommendations using user similarity matrices
- Cosine similarity implementation for identifying like-minded users
- Scalable approach handling sparse user-item interactions effectively

### **Content-Based Recommendations**
- TF-IDF vectorization of article content for semantic analysis
- SVD dimensionality reduction for computational efficiency
- K-means clustering (50 clusters) for grouping similar articles
- Robust similarity scoring using cosine distance metrics

### **Matrix Factorization with SVD**
- Advanced latent factor modeling using Singular Value Decomposition
- Optimal feature selection analysis (150-200 latent features recommended)
- Sophisticated similarity calculations based on decomposed user-item matrices
- Performance evaluation across multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

## Technical Implementation

### **Algorithm Comparison Framework**

The project includes a comprehensive comparison of all four methods, analyzing:

- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, relevance, and diversity of recommendations
- **Computational Efficiency**: Runtime and scalability considerations  
- **Data Requirements**: How each method handles sparse data and cold start problems
- **Use Case Optimization**: Strategic deployment based on user characteristics and available data

### **Key Technical Insights**

**Matrix Factorization Optimization**: Through systematic analysis, the optimal range of 150-200 latent features was identified, balancing model expressiveness with overfitting prevention.

**Content-Based Enhancement**: The combination of TF-IDF vectorization with K-means clustering creates a powerful semantic understanding system that captures both keyword relevance and thematic similarity.

**Hybrid Strategy**: The project demonstrates how different methods complement each other, suggesting a strategic approach where method selection depends on user interaction history and data availability.
